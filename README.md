## The sorting Algorithms 

Sorting Algorithms are used to re-arrange a given array or list of elements according to a comparison operator on the elements.

The compariosn operator is used to decide the new order of elements in their respective data structures.

Efficient sorting algorithm is important for optimizing the efficiency of other algorithms such as search and merge algorithms that require the input data to be in sorted list.
